## **Testing:**
All pages have been tested on all screen sizes. This has been done via Google Chrome developer tools and by testing on my phone and iPad. Also, all features of the page are scaling as intended in tablet and mobile devices.

I checked the registration form to see if an error occurred when entering an existing username or email, and the form validations react as expected. Also, if the confirmation password does not match the password, it will cause an error. I made sure that the login form will cause an error if the username and password entered are not registered in the database. For registration user name must be four characters or more or it will throw an error message, if the password is too similar to the email address it will throw an error message, the password also needs to contain at least eight characters. A verification email is sent on completion of the registration process.

I also checked to see if the number next to the cart is updated when a product is added or removed. Toast error, info, success, and warning pop messages are displayed every step of the way during the various processes. While testing the checkout process, I made sure that a new customer who does not have a payment card attached to his account will have to add a card to complete the checkout process. The change card functionality on the finalize checkout page has been tested with different cards to make sure it is working correctly and redirects back as intended. The Stripe payment function has been verified and all transactions show up on the Stripe dashboard. Both registered and guest users are allowed to purchase products on the site. All links and forms are verified to be working correctly via manual testing. Upon product purchases, a success message is displayed to the top right of the page from the bag, along with an order confirmation email being sent to the shopper, and order information is listed.

- Passing the HTML code from all templates into the [W3C Markup Validator](https://validator.w3.org/) generates numerous errors, but these are expected as the validator is unable to understand the Django template tags.
#### **CSS**
- The CSS code passes [W3C CSS Validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) Service with two unknown errors.

#### **JavaScript**
- The JavaScript code passes trough [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) without errors.

The project was tested to ensure full usability across the following browsers:

- Google Chrome

- Mozilla Firefox

- Microsoft Edge
### **Known Bugs and fixes**

Problems experienced during deployment this was remedied by recreating the **AWS** bucket

Both the register and the login form pages on mobile were moving from left to right this was fixed by adding media queries for both mobile and tablet and adding CSS   body, html {overflow-x: hidden !important};
### **Deployment:**
This project is deployed on heroku: https://furnitureplus.herokuapp.com/

Because Heroku cannot host static files, during development, they were pushed to Amazon AWS in a S3-Bucket.

**Local Deployment**

Before you can deploy and run this application locally, you must have the following installed on your system:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) - to run the application.
- [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) - to install all app requirements.
- An IDE of your choice.
- [GIT](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git) - for cloning and version control.
- Next, perform the following steps:

- Sign up or log in to Heroku account using the heroku website, click new create new app, giving it a name and, choose the region closest to you. then on the resources tab, provision a new Postgress database, choose a free plan.

- To use Postgress we need to go back to gitpod and install dj-database_url and psycopg2, using pip3 install dj-database_url, and pip3 install psycopg2-binary now freeze the requirements with pip3 freeze requirements.txt, to make sure heroku installs all our apps requirements when we deploy it.

- Next, go to settings.py and at the top import dj-database_url, then down in the database settings comment out the default configuration, and replace the default database with a call to dj-database_url.parse, and give it the database url from heroku which you can get from your config variables in your app settings tab, or from the command line by typing heroku config, save your progress now we are ready to connect to heroku.

- Because we are connecting to Postgress for the first time we need to run migrations, by typing Python3 manage.py migrate. Import product data by using fixtures by loading the categories first then products, to load categories type python3 manage.py loaddata categories and then the same for products.

- At this point you will need to create a super user by typing python3 manage.py create a superuser, choose a name input email, and choose a create a password verify the password. The heroku app and database are now ready. Before committing remove the Heroku database config so that it doesn't end up in version control, uncomment the original database.

- Let's use an if statement in settings.py so that when our app is running on Heroku where the database URL environment variable will be defined.
We connect to Postgres and otherwise, we connect to sequel light.

- First, we need to install unicorn, which will act as our webserver, and freeze that into our requirements file. Now we can create our Procfile,
To tell Heroku to create a web dyno that will run unicorn and serve our django app.

- Next, we need to temporarily disable collectstatic by using Heroku config set, disable collectstatic equals 1 so that Heroku won't try to collect static files when we deploy.

- We'll need to add the hostname of our Heroku app to allowed hosts in settings.py, we can also add localhost in here so that gitpod will still work too.

We can now deploy our app, by adding and committing our changes pushing to github with git push, and then using git push Heroku master to deploy to Heroku.

- I'll go to my app in Heroku. And on the deploy tab set it to connect to github, search for my repository and then click connect, we can enable automatic deploys, and now every time we push to github, our code will automatically be deployed to Heroku as well.

- I'll set debug to be true only if there's a variable called development in the environment, and now I'll commit these changes and push them to github. Navigating to Heroku we can see there's a build-in progress, and our automatic deployments are working.

**You must create accounts with both Stripe and Amazon S3**.

- Sign up for a free Amazon AWS account to host your staticfiles and media files. From the S3 buckets section, you'll need to create a new unique bucket.

- After creating your AWS S3 Bucket, you should now be able to push the static files to AWS using this command: python manage.py collectstatic.

- Sign up for a free [Stripe](https://stripe.com/en-se?utm_campaign=paid_brand-SE_en_Search_Brand_Stripe-1436985502&utm_medium=cpc&utm_source=google&ad_content=301857629964&utm_term=kwd-295607662702&utm_matchtype=e&utm_adposition=&utm_device=c&gclid=CjwKCAjwzMeFBhBwEiwAzwS8zEPMOT3Ep4jOOFWC1x1NoXI4wZApqNqQNK7i2mygsnJ34i6_2F5k8RoC3esQAvD_BwE) account. Navigate to the **Developers** section, and click on **API Keys**. You should have two confidential keys, (**Publishable Key and Secret Key**) which need to be added to your .env file, as well as your Heroku config vars.

    - Create a .env file containing the following environmental variables:
    - STRIPE_PUB_KEY: Used to identify your account with Stripe;
    - STRIPE_SECRET_KEY: Standard secret key.
    - AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: AWS user credentials.
    - AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: AWS S3 credentials.
    - DATABASE_URL: Remote PostgreSQL database link if using a remote database.

**Your project should be completely set up and ready for remote deployment!**

**I haven't changed the remaining django errors because they are either migrations or auto-generated by Django**.
